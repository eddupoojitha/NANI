    <p>
        As an undergraduate, Nani got addicted to movies, citing Mani Ratnam as a major influence.He wanted to become a
        director; however, producer Anil Kumar Koneru allowed him to work on his production, Radha Gopalam (2005), as a
        "clap director", alongside director Bapu.He then worked for films including Allari Bullodu (2005), Astram
        (2006), and Dhee (2007). Nani took a break, to work on a film script. Bhargavi Mallela, a friend of his, who was
        then working as a RJ for World Space Satellite, offered Nani work as an RJ.He accepted the offer and worked
        there for one year, hosting a program named "Non-Stop Nani".<br>

        Director Mohan Krishna Indraganti noticed Nani in an advertisement and offered him a role in the aforementioned
        film Ashta Chamma, also starring Swati Reddy.[ Ashta Chamma was well received by critics and Nani's performance
        was praised by them. Sify.com wrote "Nani has a very good screen presence. He has good emotions and dances well,
        though his body language sometimes reminds of Subhalekha Sudhakar – May this be treated as a compliment to the
        ease that the veteran actor shows on the screen! His addiction is good too." His second film, Ride, was produced
        by Bellamkonda Suresh, with Tanish, Swetha Basu Prasad and Aksha Pardasany playing important roles.Ride was also
        a notable success at the box office. He next starred in Satyam Bellamkonda's film Snehituda... opposite Maadhavi
        Latha. Snehituda... opened to negative reviews and the film was a flop at the box office. In 2010, he played the
        main role in the film Bheemili Kabaddi Jattu, a remake of Vennila Kabadi Kuzhu, with Saranya Mohan reprising her
        role as the heroine. The film opened to positive reviews with Nani's performance receiving appreciation.
        Rediff.com said Nani "perfectly fits into the role" and commended him for selecting the script, and One India
        commented that Nani "has given his best" and was "suited perfectly to the role".The film was a surprise hit at
        the box office
